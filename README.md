# About
himewm is a dynamic tiling window manager for Windows 11 focused around the use of custom, user-defined layouts. Being designed to work as an extension to the native window management features in Windows, himewm has a fairly minimal feature set; its purpose is to tile windows with minimal bloat. 

himewm is controlled using customizable hotkeys, which are built-in. 

Layouts are user-defined and use JSON. Configuration files are also in JSON.

# Status
himewm is currently usable, but very unstable.
